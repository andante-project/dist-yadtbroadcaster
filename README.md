Distributed Wamp Router
=======================

Multiple Wamp Router forming a cluster, allowing clients to subscribe and
publish to any of them

based on the [simple router example](https://github.com/bwegh/erwa.git)

tl;dr
-----

``` bash
$ make

$ ./_rel/dist_wamp_router/bin/dist_wamp_router foreground
```

Then point your browser twice to port 8080...

Also have a look at [the Wamp specification](http://wamp.ws/spec) for further
informations on the possibilities.
